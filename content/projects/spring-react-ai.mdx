Building a full-stack project with Spring, React, and the Open AI API is a great way to create a robust and scalable application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence. This post will introduce you to the basics of building such a project.

## What is the Project About?

The project we will be building is a simple chatbot that uses the Open AI API to generate responses to user queries. The backend will be built using Spring Boot, which will handle the API calls to the Open AI API and provide a RESTful API for the frontend to consume. The frontend will be built using React, which will handle user input and display the chatbot's responses.


@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}


## Why use Spring, React, and Open AI API?

Using Spring, React, and the Open AI API is a great choice for building a full-stack project because it allows you to leverage the strengths of each technology. Spring Boot provides a robust and scalable backend framework, React provides a dynamic and responsive frontend framework, and the Open AI API provides access to powerful AI capabilities.

## How to use Spring, React, and Open AI API

To use Spring, React, and the Open AI API, you need to create a new Spring Boot project for the backend and a new React project for the frontend. For the backend, you can use the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency to enable web support in your project and the `openai-java` library to interact with the Open AI API.

For the frontend, you can use the React CLI to create a new React project. Once you have both projects set up, you can start building your full-stack application by creating RESTful APIs in the backend to interact with the Open AI API and consuming them in the frontend using React's HTTP client.

To get started, you can check out the example project at https://github.com/mounirrouissi/spring-ai/tree/master.

Here's a simple example of how you can create a RESTful API in Spring Boot to generate a response from the Open AI API:


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/chat")
public class ChatController {

    @PostMapping
    public String generateResponse(@RequestBody String query) {
        // Assuming there's a service to interact with the Open AI API
        return openAIService.generateResponse(query);
    }
}


And here's an example of how you can consume this API in React:


import { Component, useState } from 'react';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

class ChatComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    query: '',
    response: ''
  };

  handleQueryChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ query: event.target.value });
  };

  handleSubmit = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query: this.state.query }),
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({ response: data });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={this.state.query}
          onChange={this.handleQueryChange}
          placeholder="Ask me anything..."
        />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>Ask</button>
        <p>{this.state.response}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}


## Conclusion

Building a full-stack project with Spring, React, and the Open AI API is a great way to create a robust and scalable application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence. This post has introduced you to the basics of building such a project and provided a simple tutorial on how to get started with building a full-stack application using these technologies.
