## How to Run the Frontend Application

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- NPM
- Angular CLI

Run the following commands to start the frontend application:


```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

How to Build the Backend Services
Run the following command to build and package the backend services into a Docker container:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:build-image -DdockerPassword=<your-docker-account-password>

```

This command will build and package the services into a Docker container and push it to your Docker Hub account.

How to Run the Backend Services
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Java 21
Docker
Kind Cluster - Installation Instructions
Start Kind Cluster
Run the k8s/kind/create-kind-cluster.sh script to create the Kind Kubernetes cluster:


```bash
./k8s/kind/create-kind-cluster.sh

```

This will create a Kind cluster and pre-load all the required Docker images into the cluster, saving you time downloading the images when you deploy the application.

Deploy the Infrastructure
Run the k8s/manifests/infrastructure.yaml file to deploy the infrastructure:


```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/infrastructure.yaml

```


Deploy the Services
Run the k8s/manifests/applications.yaml file to deploy the services:


```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/manifests/applications.yaml

```

Access the Keycloak Admin Console
To access the Keycloak admin console, you need to port-forward the Keycloak service to your local machine:


```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/keycloak 8080:8080

```

Access the Grafana Dashboards
To access the Grafana dashboards, you need to port-forward the Grafana service to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000

```
