Spring Boot is a powerful Java framework that makes it easy to build robust backend
services. This post will introduce you to the basics of Spring Boot.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a Java framework that allows you to build robust backend services
with ease. It provides a number of features out of the box, such as auto-configuration,
embedded servers, and production-ready metrics, that make it easy to build fast and
scalable backend services.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

## Why use Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a great choice for building robust backend services because it provides
a number of features that make it easy to build fast and scalable applications. Some of
the key features of Spring Boot include:

- Auto-configuration: Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on
  the dependencies you have in your classpath.
- Embedded servers: Spring Boot can run your application using an embedded server, such
  as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow.
- Production-ready metrics: Spring Boot can provide production-ready metrics, such as
  memory usage, garbage collection, and HTTP requests.

## How to use Spring Boot

To use Spring Boot, you need to create a new Spring Boot project by running the following
command:

```bash
spring init --name=my-app --dependencies=web my-app
```

This will create a new Spring Boot project in a directory called `my-app`. You can then
navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following
command:

```bash
cd my-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will start the development server and open your Spring Boot application in your
browser. You can then start building your application by creating new controllers, services,
and repositories.

## Conclusion

Spring Boot is a powerful Java framework that makes it easy to build robust backend services.
This post has introduced you to the basics of Spring Boot and explained why you might want to
use it in your projects.
