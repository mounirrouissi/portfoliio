Spring Boot with Kafka is a powerful combination for building robust and scalable backend services. This
post will introduce you to the basics of Spring Boot with Kafka.

## What is Spring Boot with Kafka?

Spring Boot with Kafka is a combination of the Spring Boot framework and the Apache Kafka messaging system. This
means that you can use Spring Boot to build robust backend services and Kafka to handle message-based communication
between services.

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

## Why use Spring Boot with Kafka?

Spring Boot with Kafka is a great way to build scalable and fault-tolerant backend services that require message-based communication. By using Spring Boot with Kafka, you can easily
build services that can handle high volumes of messages and scale horizontally.

## How to use Spring Boot with Kafka

To use Spring Boot with Kafka, you need to add the Kafka dependencies to your Spring Boot project. For example, you can use the `spring-kafka` dependency to enable Kafka support in your project.

Once you have the dependencies added, you can start building Spring Boot services that use Kafka for message-based communication.

## Conclusion

Spring Boot with Kafka is a powerful combination for building robust and scalable backend services. This
post has introduced you to the basics of Spring Boot with Kafka and explained why you might want to
use it in your projects.
