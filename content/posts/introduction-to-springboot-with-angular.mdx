Spring Boot with Angular is a powerful combination for building robust and scalable full-stack applications. This
post will introduce you to the basics of Spring Boot with Angular and provide a simple tutorial.

## What is Spring Boot with Angular?

Spring Boot with Angular is a combination of the Spring Boot framework for building robust backend services and the Angular framework for building dynamic frontend applications. This
means that you can use Spring Boot to build robust backend services and Angular to build dynamic frontend applications that interact with the backend services.

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

## Why use Spring Boot with Angular?

Spring Boot with Angular is a great way to build scalable and maintainable full-stack applications. By using Spring Boot with Angular, you can easily
build services that can handle high volumes of requests and scale horizontally, while also providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## How to use Spring Boot with Angular

To use Spring Boot with Angular, you need to create a new Spring Boot project for the backend and a new Angular project for the frontend. For the backend, you can use the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency to enable web support in your project.

For the frontend, you can use the Angular CLI to create a new Angular project. Once you have both projects set up, you can start building your full-stack application by creating RESTful APIs in the backend and consuming them in the frontend using Angular's HTTP client.

Here's a simple example of how you can create a RESTful API in Spring Boot to return a list of books:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/books")
public class BookController {

    @GetMapping
    public List<Book> getBooks() {
        // Assuming there's a service to fetch books
        return bookService.getBooks();
    }
}
```

And here's an example of how you can consume this API in Angular:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-book-list',
  templateUrl: './book-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./book-list.component.css']
})
export class BookListComponent implements OnInit {
  books: any[];

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/books')
      .subscribe(data => {
        this.books = data;
      });
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Spring Boot with Angular is a powerful combination for building robust and scalable full-stack applications. This
post has introduced you to the basics of Spring Boot with Angular and provided a simple tutorial on how to get started with building a full-stack application using these technologies.
